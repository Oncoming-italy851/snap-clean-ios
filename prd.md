Snap Clean — iOS Media Cleanup App

---

## 0. WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING

You are building a **native iOS application** that helps users manage, clean, and organise the photos and videos on their iPhone. The core UX is a **Tinder-style swipe interface** — the user sees one media item at a time, swipes left to delete, swipes right to organise into albums. On top of this foundation sits a full suite of intelligent cleanup tools: duplicate detection, video compression, screenshot cleaner, blurry photo detection, storage dashboards, and more.

The app is **free with no in-app purchases**. There are no paywalls. Every feature is available to every user.

The app is **personal-use only** — it never uploads any media to any server. All processing is on-device.

## 1. TECH STACK

| Concern | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Swift 5.9+ | No Objective-C |
| UI Framework | SwiftUI | Use UIKit via `UIViewRepresentable` only where SwiftUI cannot achieve something (e.g. gesture-heavy card stacks) |
| Photo Access | PhotoKit (`Photos` framework) | Primary interface to the device library |
| Image Analysis | Vision framework | Blur detection, face detection, perceptual hashing for near-duplicates |
| Video Processing | AVFoundation + `AVAssetExportSession` | Video compression, duration/size reading |
| Persistence | SwiftData | Store swipe history, compression history, app preferences |
| Notifications | `UserNotifications` framework | Local-only scheduled reminders |
| Minimum iOS | iOS 17 | Required for SwiftData; enables modern SwiftUI APIs |
| Xcode | Latest stable | |
| Architecture | MVVM + SwiftData | One `ViewModel` per major screen; `@Observable` macro throughout |

**Do not use any third-party dependencies.** Use only Apple-provided frameworks.

---

## 2. PERMISSIONS

Request the following permissions at the appropriate moment (never upfront all at once):

- **Photo Library (full access):** Required. Request when the user first opens the app. Use `PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite, handler:)`. If denied, show an in-app guidance screen that deep-links to Settings.
- **Notifications:** Optional. Request only when the user enables "Cleanup Reminders" in Settings. Use `UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization`.

## 5. FEATURE SPECIFICATIONS

---

### 5.1 SWIPE SESSION (Core Feature)

**Entry point:** Swipe tab → user picks a filter → session begins.

#### 5.1.1 Filter / Feed Modes

On the Swipe home screen, show four filter options as large tappable cards:

| Filter | Description |
|---|---|
| **All Media** | Every `PHAsset` in the library, newest first |
| **Not in Any Album** | Assets not in any user-created `PHAssetCollection` of type `.album`. Exclude smart albums. |
| **Specific Album** | User picks an album from a list; only that album's assets are shown |
| **Not Swiped Yet** | *(Default)* Assets with no `SwipeRecord` in SwiftData. First-time users see everything here. |

Tapping a filter starts the Swipe Session with that filtered asset list.

#### 5.1.2 Card Stack UI

- Show a **stack of cards** — the top card is full-screen with the next card slightly visible underneath (scaled down ~5%, offset down ~10pt) to hint continuity.
- Each card shows:
  - The photo/video thumbnail (full bleed, aspect-fill)
  - For videos: duration badge (bottom-left), a play icon overlay
  - For Live Photos: Live badge (top-left)
  - Date taken (bottom, subtle overlay)
  - File size (bottom-right, subtle)
- **Drag gesture:** User drags the card. As they drag:
  - Left drag → card rotates slightly CCW, red "DELETE" label fades in (top-left of card)
  - Right drag → card rotates slightly CW, green "KEEP" label fades in (top-right of card)
  - Threshold: if drag exceeds 40% of screen width and is released, the swipe commits. Otherwise the card snaps back.
- **Haptic feedback:** Light impact on drag start. Heavy impact on committed swipe.
- **Button bar below the card:** Three buttons — ✕ (delete), ✦ (info/details), ✓ (add to album). These trigger the same actions as swiping.

#### 5.1.3 Swipe Left → Delete

1. Animate card flying off screen to the left.
2. Call `PHPhotoLibrary.shared().performChanges { PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets([asset]) }`.
3. Save a `SwipeRecord(decision: .deleted)` to SwiftData.
4. Show next card.
5. If the deletion requires user confirmation (iOS shows a system alert for photo deletion), handle that dialog gracefully.

#### 5.1.4 Swipe Right → Add to Album Flow

1. Animate card flying off to the right.
2. Present a **bottom sheet** (not a full-screen modal) with:
   - Title: "Add to Album"
   - Horizontal scrollable row of the user's **5 most recently used albums** (show album cover thumbnail + name)
   - Below that: a grid of **all user albums** (sorted alphabetically)
   - A **"+ New Album"** button at the top
   - A **"Skip"** button (text button, bottom) — skips adding to album, saves `SwipeRecord(decision: .skipped)`
3. Tapping an album: adds the asset to that album via `PHAssetCollectionChangeRequest.addAssets`. Saves `SwipeRecord(decision: .addedToAlbum, albumLocalIdentifier: album.localIdentifier)`.
4. Tapping "+ New Album": shows a text field inline to enter album name. On confirm, creates album, adds asset, dismisses sheet.
5. After any album action: dismiss sheet and advance to next card.

#### 5.1.5 Session End

When all assets in the current filter are exhausted, show a **completion screen** with:
- A checkmark animation
- Count of deleted, organised, and skipped assets in this session
- Estimated storage freed (sum of deleted asset sizes, fetched via `PHAsset.resource(for:)`)
- Buttons: "Start Another Session" (returns to filter picker) and "Go to Cleanup Tools"

#### 5.1.6 iCloud Photo Handling

Before displaying a card, check if the asset's data is locally available:
```swift
let resources = PHAssetResource.assetResources(for: asset)
let isLocal = resources.first?.value(forKey: "locallyAvailable") as? Bool ?? false
```
If not local: show a subtle iCloud download indicator on the card. Trigger download with `PHImageManager` using `isNetworkAccessAllowed: true` and `deliveryMode: .highQualityFormat`. Do not block the user — they can swipe past before download completes; just show a spinner overlay.

---

### 5.2 CLEANUP TOOLS TAB

A grid/list of cleanup modules. Each module shows: icon, name, a one-line description, and a **badge showing the count of items found** (computed asynchronously on tab load, cached for the session).

---

#### 5.2.1 Duplicate Finder

**What it does:** Finds exact and near-duplicate photos and videos.

**Exact duplicates:** Group assets by SHA-256 hash of their data. Assets in the same group are exact duplicates. Fetch asset data via `PHAssetResourceManager.requestData`.

**Near-duplicates (photos only):** Use Vision framework's `VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest` to generate a feature vector for each photo. Compute cosine distance between vectors. Group photos where distance < 0.1 (tuneable threshold) as near-duplicates.

**Duplicate videos:** Group videos by `(duration rounded to 0.5s, file size within 1MB tolerance)`.

**UI:**
- Show groups in a list. Each group shows a horizontal strip of thumbnails.
- Tapping a group expands to full-screen comparison view:
  - Thumbnails of all duplicates side by side (scrollable horizontally if >2)
  - Tap any thumbnail to see it full-screen
  - For each asset: date taken, file size, resolution, whether it's in an album
  - One asset per group is auto-selected as "Best" (highest resolution; if tie, most recently modified)
  - User can change which to keep
  - "Delete all others" button — deletes all non-selected assets in the group
- "Delete All Duplicates (Auto)" button at top of list — auto-selects best in each group and deletes the rest. Confirm via alert before executing.
- Progress bar while scanning (this is computationally heavy — run on a background actor).

---

#### 5.2.2 Similar Photo Clustering

**What it does:** Groups photos taken close together in time (burst-like, but not necessarily marked as bursts by iOS).

**Logic:**
1. Fetch all photos sorted by `creationDate`.
2. Group photos where consecutive items are within 5 seconds of each other (configurable in Settings).
3. Each group must have ≥ 2 photos to be shown.
4. Also identify iOS burst photos via `PHAsset.representsBurst == true`.

**UI:**
- List of groups, each showing a count badge and a 3-thumbnail preview strip.
- Tapping a group: grid view of all photos in the group.
- User taps to select which ones to **keep** (multi-select). By default, the sharpest one is pre-selected (use Vision blur scoring — `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest` sharpness or `VNGenerateImageFeaturePrintRequest` confidence).
- "Delete unselected" button.
- Swipe-gesture UI also available within a group (same engine as main swipe session, but bounded to this group).

---

#### 5.2.3 Screenshot Cleaner

**What it does:** Surfaces all screenshots for quick batch review and deletion.

**Detection:** `PHAsset.mediaSubtype.contains(.photoScreenshot)`

**UI:**
- Grid view (3 columns) of all screenshots, sorted newest first.
- Tap to enter fullscreen preview with swipe navigation between screenshots.
- Multi-select mode: tap "Select" to enter selection mode. Select all / deselect all. Delete selected.
- Sort options: Newest, Oldest, Largest.
- Show total count and total size at top.
- Integrate the swipe session: "Review with Swipe" button launches a swipe session scoped to screenshots only.

---

#### 5.2.4 Blurry & Low-Quality Photo Detector

**What it does:** Identifies photos that are likely out-of-focus, too dark, or overexposed.

**Detection pipeline (run in background):**
- **Blur:** Use `VNGenerateAttentionBasedSaliencyImageRequest` or run a Laplacian variance calculation on a downsized version of the image. Photos with variance below a threshold (e.g. 100) are flagged as blurry.
- **Dark/overexposed:** Compute average luminance of the image histogram. Flag photos with mean luminance < 30 (dark) or > 225 (overexposed).
- Run only on `.photo` mediaType assets.

**UI:**
- Tabbed view: "Blurry" | "Too Dark" | "Overexposed"
- Grid view within each tab (3 columns). Tapping opens fullscreen.
- Multi-select + batch delete.
- Show confidence score as a subtle bar indicator on each thumbnail.
- "Review with Swipe" button per tab.

---

#### 5.2.5 Large File Finder

**What it does:** Lists all media assets sorted by file size, so the user can identify and delete the largest files first.

**Data source:** `PHAssetResource.assetResources(for: asset)` → sum `value(forKey: "fileSize")` across resources.

**UI:**
- List view, sorted by size descending (default). Toggle to sort by duration (for videos).
- Each row: thumbnail, filename/date, resolution/duration, **file size prominently displayed**.
- Configurable minimum size threshold slider at top (default: show files > 10 MB).
- Multi-select + batch delete.
- Running total of "selected size" shown in the delete button ("Delete 3 items · 847 MB").
- Segmented control: All | Photos | Videos.

---

#### 5.2.6 Burst Photo Cleaner

**What it does:** Specifically handles iOS-native burst photo groups.

**Detection:** `PHAsset.representsBurst == true` and `PHAsset.burstIdentifier` to group them.

**Fetch strategy:** Fetch burst representative photos, then use `PHFetchOptions` with `includeAllBurstAssets = true` to get all frames in each burst.

**UI:**
- List of burst groups: show count of frames, date, strip of first 5 thumbnails.
- Tapping a group: horizontal swipe-through of all frames with the following per frame:
  - Sharpness indicator (computed via Vision)
  - "Keep" toggle
  - Date/time to millisecond precision
- Best frame is pre-selected. User confirms/changes. "Delete rest" action.
- "Auto-clean all bursts" button: keeps the best-scored frame in each burst, deletes the rest. Confirm before executing.

---

#### 5.2.7 Live Photos → Stills Converter

**What it does:** Converts Live Photos to static images to save storage.

**Detection:** `PHAsset.mediaSubtype.contains(.photoLive)`

**Conversion approach:**
1. Export the still component using `PHAssetResourceManager.requestData(for:)` on the resource with type `.photo`.
2. Save the still as a new asset via `PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAsset(from: UIImage)`.
3. Delete the original Live Photo asset.

**UI:**
- List of all Live Photos: thumbnail, file size (combined still + video component), date.
- Show "Live" badge on each.
- Per-item convert button. Also "Convert All" with confirmation.
- Show before/after estimated size (Live ≈ 4–8 MB; still ≈ 2–4 MB). Show savings.
- After conversion, show a success state on the row.

---

#### 5.2.8 Video Compression

**What it does:** Re-encodes selected videos at lower quality to reclaim storage.

**Export presets available (user chooses):**

| Label | AVAssetExportPreset | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1080p HD | `AVAssetExportPreset1920x1080` | Good default |
| 720p | `AVAssetExportPreset1280x720` | Major savings |
| 480p | `AVAssetExportPreset640x480` | Maximum compression |

**Flow:**
1. User opens Video Compression tool — sees a list of all videos, sorted by file size descending.
2. Each row: thumbnail, date, duration, current resolution, current file size.
3. User taps a video to select export quality and see an **estimated output file size** (compute based on bitrate × duration).
4. User can select multiple videos via multi-select.
5. Tapping "Compress" starts a background `AVAssetExportSession` queue (max 2 concurrent).
   - Export the video to a temporary directory.
   - Save the compressed video as a new `PHAsset` via `PHAssetChangeRequest.creationRequestForAssetFromVideo`.
   - Delete the original asset.
   - Save a `CompressionRecord` to SwiftData.
6. Show a **live progress bar** per video during compression. App can be backgrounded; use `BGProcessingTask` to continue compression in background.
7. Show total storage reclaimed after completion.
8. Compression history: a sub-screen listing all past compressions with before/after sizes.

**Edge cases:**
- Do not offer to compress videos already at 480p or below.
- If the device is low on free storage (< 2× video size), warn the user before starting.
- Videos stored only in iCloud (not downloaded): prompt to download first.

---

#### 5.2.9 Recently Deleted Purge

**What it does:** Shows the contents of the iOS "Recently Deleted" smart album and allows permanent deletion.

**Data source:**
```swift
let deletedAlbum = PHAssetCollection.fetchAssetCollections(
    with: .smartAlbum,
    subtype: .smartAlbumDeletedAssets,
    options: nil
).firstObject
```

**UI:**
- Grid of assets in recently deleted.
- Show each item's original deletion date and how many days remain before auto-purge.
- Show total size at top.
- "Permanently Delete All" button → calls `PHAssetChangeRequest.deleteAssets` on all assets in this collection. This triggers the system confirmation alert; handle it.
- Multi-select for partial deletion.
- **Note:** iOS may restrict access to this album depending on system state. If `deletedAlbum` is nil or empty, show a message explaining that the Recently Deleted folder is not accessible from third-party apps on this iOS version, and guide the user to Photos app → Albums → Recently Deleted.

---

### 5.3 STORAGE DASHBOARD TAB

A rich analytics screen showing the user's media storage breakdown and trends.

#### 5.3.1 Current Breakdown

Fetch all assets grouped by `mediaType` and `mediaSubtype`. Compute total file size per category using `PHAssetResource`.

Display as:
- A **donut/ring chart** (built in SwiftUI using `Canvas` or `Path`) showing:
  - Photos (blue)
  - Videos (purple)
  - Screenshots (yellow)
  - Live Photos (teal)
  - Other (grey)
- Below the chart: a legend with each category, item count, and total size.
- Total library size vs total device storage (use `FileManager.default.attributesOfFileSystem(forPath:)` for device storage).

#### 5.3.2 iCloud Status

- Count of assets available locally vs iCloud-only (not downloaded).
- "iCloud-only" assets: those where `PHAsset.resource.isLocallyAvailable == false`.
- Show size represented by iCloud-only assets.
- If "Optimise iPhone Storage" is not enabled, show a tip card suggesting the user enable it (deep-link to `App-prefs:root=PHOTOS`).

#### 5.3.3 Storage Trend

- On every app launch, capture a `StorageSnapshot` to SwiftData (at most once per day — check if a snapshot already exists for today before saving).
- Display a **line chart** (using SwiftUI Charts framework) of total library size over the last 30 days.
- Show delta: "You've added X GB of media in the last 30 days."

#### 5.3.4 Cleanup Opportunities Summary

A quick-action section showing:
- "X duplicate groups found — free up Y MB"
- "X screenshots — free up Y MB"
- "X videos over 100 MB — Y GB total"
- Each row is tappable and navigates directly to that cleanup tool.

This section is computed async when the tab loads. Show skeleton placeholders while computing.

---

### 5.4 SETTINGS TAB

Simple settings screen with the following options:

| Setting | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Similar Photo Time Window | Slider (1–60 seconds) | 5 seconds | For Similar Photos clustering |
| Blur Detection Sensitivity | Segmented (Low/Med/High) | Medium | Adjusts Laplacian variance threshold |
| Large File Threshold | Slider (5–500 MB) | 10 MB | For Large File Finder |
| Default Swipe Filter | Picker | Not Swiped Yet | Sets default filter on swipe home |
| Cleanup Reminders | Toggle | Off | Enables weekly local notification |
| Reminder Day | Day picker | Sunday | Shown only if reminders enabled |
| Video Compression Default Preset | Picker | 1080p HD | |
| Reset Swipe History | Button | — | Clears all SwipeRecord entries. Confirm before executing. |
| About | Section | — | App version, build, acknowledgements |

---

### 5.5 SMART AUTOMATION & NOTIFICATIONS

When **Cleanup Reminders** is enabled in Settings:
- Schedule a weekly `UNCalendarNotificationTrigger` for the chosen day at 10:00 AM.
- Notification body: compute current counts for duplicates, screenshots, and large files at notification time. Example: *"You have 47 screenshots and 12 duplicate groups to review. Your library is using 14.2 GB."*
- Tapping the notification opens the Cleanup tab.
- Re-schedule the notification each time the app launches (to reflect updated content).

---

## 6. PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

- **Never block the main thread.** All PHAsset fetching, Vision analysis, file size computation, and hashing must run on background actors (`actor` or `Task { await ... }` with appropriate QoS).
- Use **pagination** in the swipe session: pre-fetch thumbnails for the next 10 cards in advance using `PHImageManager.requestImage` with `deliveryMode: .fastFormat` first, then upgrade to `.highQualityFormat`.
- Duplicate detection and blur scoring for large libraries (10,000+ photos) must show incremental progress and must not lock the UI.
- Cache computed results (duplicate groups, blur scores) in memory for the app session. Do not re-compute unless the photo library sends a `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` notification indicating new changes.
- Register as `PHPhotoLibraryChangeObserver` and invalidate relevant caches when the library changes.

---

## 7. ERROR HANDLING

- **Photo library access denied:** Show a dedicated full-screen onboarding/permission screen with an explanation and a button that opens `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString`. The app should not crash or show empty states without explaining why.
- **iCloud download failure:** Show a non-blocking toast/snackbar. Let the user swipe past.
- **AVAssetExportSession failure:** Show an alert with the specific error. Log to `os_log`. Do not silently discard.
- **SwiftData errors:** Wrap all `modelContext.save()` calls in do/catch. Log errors. Non-critical (swipe records failing to save should not crash the app).
- **Recently Deleted inaccessible:** Graceful fallback message (see 5.2.9).

---

## 8. UI/UX DESIGN DIRECTION

- **Dark mode first**, with full light mode support (use semantic colours / `Color(uiColor: .systemBackground)` throughout).
- Use **SF Symbols** for all iconography. No custom icon assets needed.
- The swipe card stack is the hero UI. It must feel **physical and responsive** — match real-world card physics (spring animation, rotation tied to drag offset).
- Transitions between screens: use SwiftUI's `.navigationTransition(.zoom)` (iOS 18) where available; fall back to `.slide`.
- Destructive actions (delete, compress+replace, purge recently deleted): always confirm with an alert that explicitly states what will happen and is irreversible.
- Loading/scanning states: use skeleton placeholders (rectangles with shimmer animation) rather than spinners for list/grid content.
- Empty states: every list/grid must have a designed empty state view with an SF Symbol illustration and a short message.

## 10. WHAT THE AGENT SHOULD FIGURE OUT INDEPENDENTLY

The following are intentionally **left to the agent's discretion**. The agent should make sensible engineering decisions:

- Exact Vision framework request chaining and concurrency management.
- Precise SwiftUI animation curves and spring parameters for the card stack (as long as it feels physically convincing).
- Whether to use `@StateObject` / `@Observable` / `@ObservedObject` — use modern `@Observable` macro throughout (iOS 17+).
- Exact SwiftData query predicates and sort descriptors.
- How to structure `PhotoLibraryService` — whether as a singleton, `@Observable`, or actor.
- Exact layout metrics (padding, corner radii, font sizes) — follow iOS HIG.
- Whether to use `LazyVGrid` or `LazyVStack` for grids — choose whichever performs better for the content density.
- `BGProcessingTask` registration and scheduling details for background video compression.
- How to handle the system-level delete confirmation alert that iOS presents — do not try to suppress it; handle it gracefully.

---

## 11. WHAT THIS APP DOES NOT DO

Explicitly out of scope — do not build:

- Any network requests, backend, or cloud sync of any kind.
- User accounts or authentication.
- Sharing functionality (beyond what iOS share sheet provides natively if the user long-presses).
- In-app purchases or subscription logic.
- App Clips.
- iPad-specific layout (phone only for now; just ensure it doesn't crash on iPad).
- Direct access to other apps' sandboxed data.
- Private API usage (`LSApplicationWorkspace` or similar) — App Store compliance required.

---

## 12. TESTING NOTES

- Build and test on a **physical iPhone**. The simulator photo library is fake and will not reflect real-world performance.
- Test with a large library (1,000+ assets) to validate background processing performance.
- Test iCloud-only asset handling by using a device with "Optimise Storage" enabled.
- Test the Recently Deleted flow on both iOS 16 and iOS 17+ as behaviour differs.
