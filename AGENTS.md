This file provides guidance to Codex (Codex.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SnapClean is a native iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI, iOS 17+) that helps users clean up their photo library. Core UX is a Tinder-style swipe interface for reviewing media. The app is free, has no backend, and all processing is on-device. **No third-party dependencies** — Apple frameworks only.

## Build & Run

- **Xcode project**: `SnapClean.xcodeproj` (generated from `project.yml` via XcodeGen)
- **Build**: `xcodebuild -project SnapClean.xcodeproj -scheme SnapClean -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build`
- **Swift version**: 5.9, strict concurrency enabled (`SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete`)
- **Min deployment**: iOS 17
- **iPhone only** (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: 1`)
- Must test on a physical device for photo library operations — simulator has a fake photo library

## Architecture

**MVVM + Actors + SwiftData**

### Services (all Swift `actor` types)
Services are instantiated on-demand, not singletons (except `ImageCache.shared`). Dependencies are injected via initializers:
- `PhotoLibraryService` — wraps all PhotoKit operations (fetching, mutations, change observation, image loading). Uses `withCheckedContinuation` to bridge PHImageManager callbacks to async/await. Accesses undocumented KVC properties (`fileSize`, `locallyAvailable`) with `responds(to:)` guards.
- `DuplicateDetectionService(photoService:, visionService:)` — exact (SHA-256) and near-duplicate (Vision feature prints) detection
- `VisionAnalysisService` — blur detection, exposure analysis, feature print generation. Works with CGImage inputs, no library access.
- `VideoCompressionService(photoService:)` — AVAssetExportSession-based compression with progress polling
- `NotificationService` — static methods only (not an actor), wraps UNUserNotificationCenter

### ViewModels
One `@Observable @MainActor` ViewModel per major screen. Progress reporting from services uses `@Sendable` closures normalized to 0.0–1.0 float range.

### Models
- **SwiftData models**: `SwipeRecord`, `CompressionRecord`, `StorageSnapshot` — simple record types with `@Model` macro
- **Value types**: `AssetSummary` (DTO decoupling UI from PHAsset), `AlbumInfo` — both `Sendable`, `Identifiable`, `Hashable`

### Design System
`Color+Theme.swift` defines the design system: `Spacing` enum (xs=4 to xxxl=32), `CornerRadius` enum, semantic colors (`appBackground`, `destructive`, `success`), category colors, gradients, and shadow view modifiers.

## Key Conventions

- **Actors for all services** — no locks, no dispatch queues
- **`@Observable` macro** throughout — not `ObservableObject`/`@StateObject`
- **`Sendable` on all value types** passed across actor boundaries
- **Long-running operations yield periodically**: `if index % 20 == 0 { await Task.yield() }`
- **Error enums** conform to `LocalizedError` (`PhotoServiceError`, `CompressionError`)
- **Non-critical failures** use `try?` (e.g., temp file cleanup, notification scheduling)
- **Tab structure**: `TabView` with independent `NavigationStack` per tab in `RootView`
